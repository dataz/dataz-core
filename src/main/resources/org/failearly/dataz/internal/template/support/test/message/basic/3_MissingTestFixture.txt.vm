Missing last argument 'testFixtureClass' in constructor of ${tc}.

Reasons: You haven't yet defined the test fixture class and/or didn't assign it to ${stbc}.


The test fixture's purpose is to have a class or method object which hold the instances of your TOA (${TOA}).
These ${TOA} instances will be resolved and the associated TOF (${TOF}) will create the TOs.

Remark: The test fixture itself will never instanciated or executed.


Step 1) Create the test fixture class and assign it.

The proposed name for your test fixture is '${tf}', but you could name it and place wherever you like.
I recommended to create as inner class of ${tc}.

Create your test fixture and use it as last argument in the constructor of ${tc}.

$snippetBegin
	/**
	 * Tests for TOA {@link ${TOA}}, {@link ${TOF}} and {@link ${fullTO}}.
	 */
    @Subject({${TOA}.class, ${TOF}.class, ${fullTO}.class})
	public class ${tc}
			extends ${stbc}<${TOA}, ${TOF}, ${fullTO}> {
		public ${tc}() {
			super(
				${TOA}.class, // TOA
				${TOF}.class, // TOF
				${fullTO}.class,  // TO
				${tf}.class   // Test Fixture
			);
		}

        /**
         * The purpose is to hold your ${TOA} annotations.
         */
		private static class ${tf} {}
	}
$snippetEnd


Step 2) So the initial steps are almost done.
        Compile and rerun ${tc}. You will get a new error message with the next steps.
